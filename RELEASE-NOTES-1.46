* Passing something other than an Authority for the $performer parameter to
  WatchlistManager methods clearTitleUserNotifications() and
  clearAllUserNotifications, deprecated since 1.37, will now throw. User
  implements Authority and so is still permitted.
* Passing something other than a PageIdentity for the $title parameter to
  WatchlistManager::getTitleNotificationTimestamp and
  clearTitleUserNotifications, deprecated since 1.37, will now throw.
* Many WatchedItemStore methods took either PageIdentity or LinkTarget, with
  LinkTarget being deprecated since 1.37. Passing a LinkTarget which is not a
  PageReference will now throw.
